            Counterpick is an web application for everyone that is interested in playing League of Legends (LoL) at amateur level.<br>
            It will consist of teams of 5 players with relatively the same skillset. So you wonâ€™t be bullied by players with a much higher ranking.<br>
            All you would need is the LoL application, our web application and a stable network connection.<br>
