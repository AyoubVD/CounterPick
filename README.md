# CounterPick

The idea for this project was to be recommend a 'counter pick' to your enemies choice of characters aka 'legends' on League of Legends (*LOL* in short).
After a few weeks in the project we realised that we could do something better than this, because we were developping something that already existed.

So after a little bit of brainstorming on how to create an added value for our application, we decided to create a platform that creates teams and tournament on player-specific (skill)levels, that way we can help the players grow in a comfortable enviroment at a non stressing pace.

We worked out a few diagrams on how the connections should be made: https://counterpick123.wordpress.com/

To be able to make all of this possible, we created a login page which in turn connected with the API of LOL to get the user information.

We used XAMPP as mean to locally host an apache server and to be able to interpret the .php files. If it worked correctly, we would host it on the following domain: https://counterpick.helpimstuckatschool.be/ using combell.
