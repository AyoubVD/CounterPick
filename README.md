# CounterPick

The idea for this project was to be recommend a 'counter pick' to your enemies choice of characters aka 'legends' on League of Legends (*LOL* in short).
After a few weeks in the project we realised that we could do something better than this, because we were developping something that already existed.

So after a little bit of brainstorming on how to create an added value for our application, we decided to create a platform that creates teams and tournament on player-specific (skill)levels, that way we can help the players grow in a comfortable enviroment at a non stressing pace.

We worked out a few diagrams on how the connections should be made: https://counterpick123.wordpress.com/ 

To be able to make all of this possible, we created a login page which in turn connected with the API of LOL to get the user information.
